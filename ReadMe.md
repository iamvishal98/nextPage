## EXPLAINATION

I have implemented all the requirements you have asked about.

So In regards to Point #3 in the assessment you have mentioned i should show available seats for some classes randomly as zero when page refresh. So my take on this was avaibale seats property should generate random number when the page reloads and some ot it being zero. With that i have implemented the app.

I have mock the api for scheduled Classes for 60days in file "data.js"

For services i have used AsyncThunk function in RTK.

So the seats were generating at random that is why i have implemented add_to_cart and remove_from_cart functionality as actions in redux.

Hope you like it ðŸ™‚.
